🤖 Smart Research Assistant – LLM-Powered Multi-Tool AgentThe Smart Research Assistant is an AI-powered system designed to autonomously interpret, plan, and solve complex natural language queries by leveraging multiple specialized tools. It showcases the power of modular, tool-augmented Large Language Model (LLM) agents in real-world task orchestration, such as performing calculations, running Python code, summarizing content, and retrieving relevant information via search.🧠 What It DoesWhen a user inputs a multi-part natural language query (e.g., “Summarize this code, calculate an expression, run some Python, and search a topic”), the assistant:Parses and understands the intent behind the full query.Decomposes the query into subtasks using rule-based planning.Selects and routes each subtask to the appropriate tool.Executes each subtask and logs all interactions.Returns a structured, final response combining all the outputs.🧱 Key Features✅ Task PlanningBreaks a compound query into discrete, logically ordered subtasks.Determines which tool should handle each subtask (e.g., summarization, computation).🧰 Integrated ToolsCalculator: Safely evaluates math expressions (e.g., 8 \\\* (3 + 2)).Code Executor: Runs lightweight Python snippets securely and returns outputs.Summarizer: Provides concise and meaningful summaries of input text.Search Module: Simulates fetching contextual search results for user-provided topics.🔄 Tool RouterDynamically routes subqueries to the correct tool based on keyword patterns.Uses pattern matching and context parsing to extract relevant segments from the input.🧠 Memory ManagementLogs every step including the original query, tool outputs, and final response.Enables transparency and potential for future context-aware improvements.🧪 Evaluation SuiteAllows benchmarking of the assistant’s reasoning, tool usage, and accuracy across various predefined tasks.Measures success via task-by-task verification and scores.🛠️ Architecture OverviewThe system is modular, comprising the following components:bashCopyEditai\_agent\_assessment/├── app.py # Streamlit frontend├── agent.py # Core agent logic (planner, router, memory)├── chains/│ └── agent\_chain.py # Orchestration controller├── tools/ # Tool-specific logic│ ├── calculator\_tool.py│ ├── code\_tool.py│ ├── summarizer\_tool.py│ └── search\_tool.py├── memory/│ └── memory\_handler.py # Logs and short-term memory├── evaluation/│ └── evaluator.py # Benchmarking suite├── logs/│ └── sample\_logs.txt # Interaction logs├── requirements.txt # Python dependencies└── README.md # Project documentation🚀 Getting StartedStep 1: Clone and Set Up Environmentgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai\_agent\_assessment.gitcd ai\_agent\_assessmentpython -m venv venvsource venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activateStep 2: Install Dependenciespip install -r requirements.txtStep 3: Run the Applicationstreamlit run app.py💬 Example QueryTry this to see all tools in action:Summarize this code: for i in range(3): print(i).
